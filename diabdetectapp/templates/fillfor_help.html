                As You Know Not Only Medicine can Cure the Diabeties
            </h2>

            <p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                Here are 12 ways to lower blood sugar naturally, many of which also
                have benefits on overall health.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Limit Carbs</strong><br>
                Carbohydrates are broken down and absorbed as sugar in the body.
                Sweets, refined grains, juices, and sodas raise blood sugar quickly.
                Replacing simple carbs with complex carbs such as whole grains and
                vegetables helps control blood sugar levels.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Drink Water</strong><br>
                Staying hydrated helps prevent blood sugar concentration.
                Avoid sugary beverages and stick to water.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Add Fiber to Your Diet</strong><br>
                Fiber does not increase blood sugar and helps improve digestion,
                cholesterol, and fullness.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Add Raw or Cooked Garlic</strong><br>
                Garlic may help improve insulin sensitivity and overall heart health.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Try Probiotics</strong><br>
                Found in yogurt and fermented foods, probiotics can help reduce
                fasting blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Eat Smaller Meals</strong><br>
                Smaller, balanced meals help prevent sugar spikes and overeating.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Don’t Skip Breakfast</strong><br>
                A healthy breakfast reduces insulin resistance.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Achieve a Healthy Weight</strong><br>
                Weight control can even help put diabetes into remission.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Exercise Regularly</strong><br>
                At least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week is recommended.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Quit Smoking</strong><br>
                Smoking increases blood sugar and insulin requirements.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Get More Sleep</strong><br>
                Aim for at least seven hours of quality sleep.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Reduce Stress</strong><br>
                Stress hormones raise blood sugar. Yoga and meditation help.
                <br><br>

                <em>
                Never abruptly stop insulin without medical advice.
                Always consult your healthcare provider before making changes.
